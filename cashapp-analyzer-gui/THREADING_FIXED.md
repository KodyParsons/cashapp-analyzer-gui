# 🎉 Threading Issues Fixed - Application Ready!

## ✅ Problem Resolved

The matplotlib threading errors you encountered have been successfully fixed! The application now runs smoothly without the "main thread is not in main loop" errors.

### 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Matplotlib Backend Configuration**: Set proper backends for threading
   - `matplotlib.use('Agg')` for analysis thread
   - `matplotlib.use('TkAgg')` for GUI thread

2. **Threading Architecture**: Separated data processing from visualization
   - Data analysis runs in background thread
   - Visualizations create in main GUI thread
   - Proper thread synchronization

3. **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for visualization failures

### 📊 Test Results
