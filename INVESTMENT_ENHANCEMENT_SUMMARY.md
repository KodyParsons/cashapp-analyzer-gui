# Investment Tracking & Top 5 Transactions Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Investment Categorization
- **Problem**: DCA savings internal transfers were all categorized as "Investment (DCA Savings)" regardless of whether they were regular savings or Bitcoin-related savings.
- **Solution**: Enhanced the categorization logic to differentiate between:
  - `Investment (DCA Savings)` - Regular savings transfers (Description: "Savings")
  - `Investment (Bitcoin Savings)` - Bitcoin-related savings transfers (Description contains "purchase of BTC")
  - `Investment (Bitcoin)` - Direct Bitcoin purchases (Transaction Type: "Bitcoin Buy" or "Bitcoin Recurring Buy")

### 2. Updated Investment Category Lists
Updated all instances of investment category lists throughout the codebase to include the new `Investment (Bitcoin Savings)` category:
- Text report generation
- Cash flow visualizations 
- PDF report generation

### 3. Restored Top 5 Transactions Report
- **Added**: "TOP 5 TRANSACTIONS BY AMOUNT" section to the text report
- **Location**: Added after the "Largest Expense" and "Largest Income" entries
- **Features**: 
  - Shows top 5 transactions by absolute amount (largest first)
  - Includes date, amount (with +/- sign), description, and category
  - Handles cases where there are fewer than 5 transactions

### 4. Fixed Numpy.float64 Error
- **Problem**: Calling `.abs()` on numpy scalar values (result of `.sum()` operations)
- **Solution**: Replaced `data.sum().abs()` with `abs(data.sum())` for scalar operations
- **Note**: Kept `.abs()` for pandas Series operations (e.g., `groupby().sum().abs()`)

## Investment Categories Now Supported

1. **Investment (Bitcoin)** - Direct Bitcoin purchases via Cash App
2. **Investment (DCA Savings)** - Regular DCA savings transfers to savings account
3. **Investment (Bitcoin Savings)** - Bitcoin purchases made through savings account transfers
4. **Investment (Potential DCA)** - Potential DCA amounts detected by pattern matching

## Code Changes Locations

### Files Modified:
- `src/analyzer/cashapp_analyzer.py`

### Key Functions Updated:
1. `categorize_transactions()` - Enhanced investment categorization logic
2. `generate_report()` - Added top 5 transactions section and updated investment categories
3. `create_cash_flow_visualizations()` - Updated investment categories
4. `generate_pdf_report()` - Updated investment categories

## Testing
- Created test script `test_investment_categories.py` to verify proper categorization
- All test cases pass successfully
- Verified differentiation between regular savings and Bitcoin savings

## Benefits
1. **Better Investment Tracking**: Users can now see the breakdown between different types of investments
2. **Enhanced Reporting**: Top 5 transactions provide better insight into largest financial activities
3. **Accurate Categorization**: Bitcoin-related savings are properly distinguished from regular DCA savings
4. **Error-Free Analysis**: Fixed numpy.float64 error for smooth operation

## Usage
The analyzer will now automatically:
- Categorize "Savings Internal Transfer" transactions with "purchase of BTC" descriptions as "Investment (Bitcoin Savings)"
- Categorize other "Savings Internal Transfer" transactions as "Investment (DCA Savings)"
- Include all investment types in financial summaries and visualizations
- Display top 5 transactions by amount in the text report
